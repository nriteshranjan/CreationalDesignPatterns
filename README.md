Welcome to the Design Patterns repository! Here, you will find examples of various design patterns used in software development.

## What are design patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They are solutions that have been tried and tested by developers over time, and are considered best practices in software development.

## Types of design patterns

There are three main types of design patterns:

1. Creational patterns
2. Structural patterns
3. Behavioral patterns

### Creational patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Creational patterns can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. Some examples of creational patterns are:

- Singleton pattern
- Factory method pattern
- Abstract factory pattern
- Builder pattern

### Structural patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition. They describe ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality. Some examples of structural patterns are:

- Adapter pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Facade pattern

### Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects, and how they operate together to achieve a goal. Some examples of behavioral patterns are:

- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern
- Chain of responsibility pattern
- Command pattern

## How to use this repository

Each design pattern has its own folder with examples of the pattern being used in various programming languages. Simply navigate to the folder for the pattern you are interested in, and explore the code examples.
